The goal was to travel in a van for as long and as far as we want. One critical aspect was that it should be comfy to live inside the van as we love the raw beauty of northen climates,

We didn't have the money to buy a fully fledged camping car, neither for a company converted van. And buying van converted by normal people over the internet was a bit scarry (who knows why they sell it in the first place, since they are so many ways a custom van build could be a failure).

I'am quite tall (1m88) and to be comfy I should be able to stand, and since we plan to go to America, a [Ford Transit (L2H3)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jZfzrEbyBuDzSYU18) seemed to be a good choice.
