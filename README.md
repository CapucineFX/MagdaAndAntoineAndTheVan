This is a blog created for private use using a python script to transform markdown files to html static pages.
It can be accessed at the URL: (https://www.afauroux.github.io/MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan/index.html)

You are welcome to use the script for your own projects (it was inspired from this [tutorial](https://florian-dahlitz.de/articles/build-a-markdown-to-html-conversion-pipeline-using-python)), and to consult my blog ðŸ˜‰, but please don't re-use the pictures without asking first.
