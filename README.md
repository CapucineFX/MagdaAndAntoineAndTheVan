This is a blog created for private use using a python script (Markdown, Jinja2, PyYAML) transform markdown files to html static pages.
It can be accessed at the URL: (https://afauroux.github.io/MagdaAndAntoineAndTheVan)

You are welcome to use the script for your own projects (it was inspired from this [tutorial](https://florian-dahlitz.de/articles/build-a-markdown-to-html-conversion-pipeline-using-python)), and to consult my blog ðŸ˜‰, but please don't re-use the pictures without asking first.
